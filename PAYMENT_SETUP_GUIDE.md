# 💳 Real Payment Gateway Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up **real payment processing** with actual money deduction for your RestOh Restaurant App.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Test Mode)

The app is already configured with **test/demo keys** that simulate real payments without charging actual money. This is perfect for development and testing.

### Current Test Configuration:
- ✅ **Stripe**: Demo keys for card payments
- ✅ **COD**: Cash on delivery (no payment required)

## 🔥 Production Setup (Real Money)

To enable **real payment processing** with actual money deduction:

### Stripe Setup (For Card Payments)

#### Step 1: Create Stripe Account
1. Go to [https://stripe.com](https://stripe.com)
2. Create a business account
3. Complete business verification
4. Get your live API keys

#### Step 2: Configure Stripe
```bash
# In backend/.env file
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_actual_stripe_secret
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_your_actual_stripe_publishable
```

#### Step 3: Enable Payment Methods
- Visa, Mastercard, American Express
- Apple Pay, Google Pay
- Buy now, pay later options

### 3. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:

```bash
# Copy from .env.example
cp .env.example .env

# Edit with your actual keys
nano .env
```

### 4. Webhook Setup (Important!)

#### Stripe Webhooks:
1. Go to Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks
2. Add endpoint: `https://yourdomain.com/api/payments/stripe/webhook`
3. Select events: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### 1. Environment Variables
- Never commit real API keys to version control
- Use different keys for development/production
- Rotate keys regularly

### 2. Webhook Security
- Verify webhook signatures
- Use HTTPS for all webhook endpoints
- Implement idempotency for webhook handling

### 3. PCI Compliance
- Never store card details on your server
- Use tokenization for recurring payments
- Implement proper logging and monitoring

## 💰 Payment Flow

### Current Implementation:

1. **User selects payment method** → Frontend
2. **Creates payment order** → Backend API call
3. **Opens payment gateway** → Stripe modal
4. **User enters payment details** → Secure payment form
5. **Payment processed** → Real money deducted
6. **Payment verified** → Webhook confirmation
7. **Order confirmed** → Database updated

## 🧪 Testing Real Payments

### Test Cards (No Real Money):

#### Stripe Test Cards:
```
Success: 4242 4242 4242 4242
CVV: Any 3 digits
Expiry: Any future date

Failure: 4000 0000 0000 0002
```
